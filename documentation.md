# The syntax 
The syntax of the editor is quite similar to html, but it's not exactly the same. It only supports a small subset of 
html listed in this documentation.

## Attributes supported on all elements
* You can give every element an `Ã¬d` property.
* Use `text-align="left"`, `text-align="center"` or `text-align="right"` to make the text left-bounded, right-bounded or
centered.

## Links
`<a href="http://example.com">Click me</a>`

`<a href="http://example.com" newtab>Click me</a>` Opens it in a new tab

`<a href="seatinfo:article/id">Click me</a>` Opens the article with id. You can find the whole url in the managment tab.

`<a href="seatinfo:resource/id">Click me</a>` Opens a resource uploaded to seat


## Links within the page
You can create links within the article to for example have a table of contents full of links that jump you to the right 
section. To create such a link, add this to jump destination: `<pagelink id="your_id">`. To actually create the link to 
the target, use a normal link like this: `<a href="#your_id">jump down</a>`.

You aren't restricted to the `pagelink` element anymore, `id` should work on any element. As of right now, it only 
remains as a compatibility element and will be removed in future versions.

## Bold
`<b>bold text</b>`


## Content separation
`<hr />` Same as the html element

The old `<hr>` syntax still works for compatibility reasons, but is deprecated.

## Newline
`<br />`

The old `<br>` syntax still works for compatibility reasons, but is deprecated.


## Titles and Subtitles
`<h1>Main title</h1>`

`<h2>Smaller title</h2>`

`<h3>Even smaller title</h3>`

`<h4>4th subtitle title</h4>`

`<h5>5th subtitle title</h5>`

`<h6>Tiny title</h6>`


## Ordered Lists
```
<ol>
    <li>list entry</li>
    <li>list entry</li>
    <li>list entry</li>
</ol>
```


## Unordered Lists
```
<ul>
    <li>list entry</li>
    <li>list entry</li>
    <li>list entry</li>
</ul>
```


## Paragraph
`<p>text</p>`

## Italic
`<i>text</i>`

## Crossed Text
`<s>crossed text</s>`

## Tables
```
<table stripes border>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column1</th>
            <th>Column2</th>
            <th>Column3</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">this thing spans two columns</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```
Add the argument `stripes` and `borders` to the table to add stripes and borders

## Images
`<img src="link-to-image.png" alt="image description" />`

You can specify a file uploaded to resources: `<img src="seatinfo:resource/id" alt="image description">`
To get the id, go to the management page. Images are put in a new paragraph. If you want the image to be inlined in the 
text, use an icon instead.

The old `<img src="...">` syntax still works for compatibility reasons, but is deprecated.

## Icons
`<icon src="link-to-image.png" alt="icon description" />`

You can specify a file uploaded to resources: `<icon src="seatinfo:resource/id" alt="icon description">`
To get the id, go to the management page. Icons are inlined in the text. If you want them to be on a new line instead, 
use an image tag.

The old `<icon src="...">` syntax still works for compatibility reasons, but is deprecated.

## Colors
```
<color color="#993399">pink</color>
```
Any css color should work.

## Audio
```
<audio src="url" />
```

The old `<audio src="...">` syntax still works for compatibility reasons, but is deprecated.
